# Theme assets

The current client bundles six unchanged original images, the earlier transparent standee, two panel crops from the user-selected phone-case photograph, and one locally authored APTX capsule SVG. Frames, cropping, silver reflections and contour shadows are CSS treatments. Source imagery is not covered by the MIT code license. Older wallpaper provenance is retained below as history; those wallpaper bytes are no longer in the client bundle.

## Earlier transparent standee

`haibara-standee.png` is the earlier phone-case-inspired transparent reconstruction generated in this task, explicitly selected again by the user. It is a distinct source from the official YTV illustration, and its bytes are unchanged. SHA-256: `f9a51ab73383dc112703111709ac2f3e35edc3df97901c4761239f4af0b8a296`. The character remains associated with the original rights holders; it is not described as an official source image.

## Home silver-frame story panels

`phonecase-panel-observe.jpg` and `phonecase-panel-gesture.jpg` are rectangular crops of the two printed panels on the user's previously selected `IMG_1338.HEIC` phone-case photograph, using its existing JPEG conversion. Only orientation, cropping, proportional downsampling and JPEG encoding were applied. Expressions and gestures were not redrawn; silver/grayscale appearance is a CSS treatment. No new external image download or generated replacement is used.

The user's authorization covers this current local customization. The depicted artwork remains associated with its original rights holders; these images are not described as MIT, public domain, or licensed for general redistribution. Crop coordinates, exact source and resulting resource SHA values are recorded in `docs/artwork/phonecase-panels.sources.json`. The complete personal photograph is not bundled.
